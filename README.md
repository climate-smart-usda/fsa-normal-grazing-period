This repository is an archive of the annual county-level normal grazing period data for the [Livestock Forage Disaster Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/livestock-forage/index). These data were acquired via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 2025-FSA-04691-F made by R. Kyle Bocinsky, Director of Climate Extension for the [Montana Climate Office](https://climate.umt.edu), to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (FPAC-BC)](https://www.fpacbc.usda.gov). The request was submitted on February 14, 2025, and was fulfilled on April 15, 2025.

The original FOIA request, copies of all email communications with the USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (FPAC-BC), and data as received are in the [`foia`](/foia) directory and [`foia/2025-FSA-04691-F Bocinsky.zip`](/foia/2025-FSA-04691-F%20Bocinsky.zip) zip archive.

Data were ingested into the [R statistical framework](https://www.r-project.org), were cleaned to a common set of fields and filtered to only include counties in the contiguous United States, and then were written to a consolidated CSV file ([`fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv`](/fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv)) and mapped in multi-page PDF ([`fsa-normal-grazing-period.pdf`](/fsa-normal-grazing-period.pdf)). [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.R`](/fsa-normal-grazing-period.R) is the R script that cleans the data and produces the maps.

The FSA uses slightly different county or county equivalent definitions for their service areas than the standard ANSI FIPS areas used by the US Census. The FSA counties are included in the [`fsa-counties`](/fsa-counties) directory; FSA county codes are detailed in [FSA Handbook 1-CM](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1-cm_r03_a80.pdf), Exhibit 101.
