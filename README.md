# FSA Normal Grazing Period Archive

This repository is an archive of the annual county-level **Normal Grazing Period (NGP)** data for the USDA [Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP)](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/livestock-forage/). Normal Grazing Periods define the historical timeframe during which forage is typically available for livestock grazing under non-drought conditions. These periods are used by the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) to determine eligibility and payment amounts for forage and crop loss due to drought.

> For more information on the role of NGPs in the LFP, refer to [FSA Handbook 1-DF, Rev. 1 Amendment 19](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1-df_r01_a19.pdf), especially paragraphs 211‚Äì213.

The data in this repository were acquired via FOIA request **2025-FSA-04691-F** by R. Kyle Bocinsky (Montana Climate Office) and fulfilled on April 15, 2025. The FOIA response, including the original Excel workbook, is archived in the [`foia`](./foia) directory.

## üì• Input Data: FOIA Excel Workbook

The FOIA response contains annual NGP data from **2008 through 2024** for each pasture type, county, and program year.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name                        | Description                                           |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Program Year`                      | Year the data applies to                              |
| `State Name`                        | U.S. state                                            |
| `County Name`                       | County or county-equivalent name                      |
| `State FSA Code`                    | FSA-assigned state code (not always ANSI/FIPS)       |
| `County FSA Code`                   | FSA-assigned county code (not always ANSI/FIPS)      |
| `Pasture Grazing Type`             | Pasture classification (e.g., Native, Improved)       |
| `Normal Grazing Period Start Date` | Start date of typical grazing period                  |
| `Normal Grazing Period End Date`   | End date of typical grazing period                    |

## üßπ Processing Workflow

The processing script [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.R`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.R):

1. **Unzips and reads** the Excel workbook.
2. **Filters records** with missing dates.
3. **Constructs an `FSA Code`** by concatenating state and county FSA codes.
4. **Cleans and standardizes** pasture type names.
5. **Corrects known data errors**, including:
   - Erroneous years and dates in KS, UT, MS, and MT records.
   - Handling duplicate and misassigned counties (e.g., Shoshone County, ID).
6. **Removes invalid or duplicate entries**.
7. **Exports** the cleaned data to [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv).
8. **Renders** an interactive Quarto dashboard.

## üì§ Output Data: Cleaned CSV

The file [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv) is a tidy dataset for analysis and visualization.

|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Program Year`                      | Year the data applies to                              |
| `State Name`                        | Full U.S. state name                                  |
| `County Name`                       | County or county-equivalent name                      |

## üìä Demonstration Dashboard

The Quarto dashboard [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.qmd`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.qmd) provides:

- An **interactive viewer** to explore NGPs by county, year, and pasture type
- Visual summaries of **seasonality and regional variation**
- A **tool for researchers and policymakers** to assess temporal trends

## üß≠ About FSA County Codes

The USDA FSA uses custom county definitions that differ from standard ANSI/FIPS codes used by the U.S. Census. To align the Normal Grazing Period data with geographic boundaries, we use the FSA-specific geospatial dataset archived in the companion repository:

üîó [**climate-smart-usda/fsa-counties-dd17**](https://climate-smart-usda.github.io/fsa-counties-dd17/)

FSA county codes are documented in [FSA Handbook 1-CM, Exhibit 101](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1-cm_r03_a80.pdf).
